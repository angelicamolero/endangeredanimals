        	<div class="panda-info">
        	<p>This peaceful creature with a distinctive black and white coat is adored by the world and considered a national treasure in China.</p>
        	<p>Pandas play a crucial role in the bamboo forests where they roam by spreading seeds and facilitating growth of vegetation. </p>
        	<p>China’s Yangtze Basin region, which holds the panda’s primary habitat, is the geographic and economic heart of this booming country. Roads and railroads are increasingly fragmenting the forest, which isolates panda populations and prevents mating. Forest destruction also reduces pandas’ access to the bamboo they need to survive.</p>

        	<div class="leopard-info">
        	<p>The Amur leopard is solitary. Nimble-footed and strong, it carries and hides unfinished kills so that they are not taken by other predators.Similar to other leopards, the Amur leopard can run at speeds of up to 37 miles per hour. This incredible animal has been reported to leap more than 19 feet horizontally and up to 10 feet vertically.</p>
        	<p>The Amur leopard is important ecologically, economically and culturally. Conservation of its habitat benefits other species, including Amur tigers and prey species like deer. With the right conservation efforts, we can bring them back and ensure long-term conservation of the region.</p>
